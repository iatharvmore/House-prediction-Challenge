House Prediction Challenge on Kaggle
This repository contains code for the House Prediction Challenge hosted on Kaggle. In this challenge, the goal is to predict the prices of houses based on various features. Advanced regression models are employed to achieve accurate predictions, and the Pycaret library is utilized for efficient model building and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this challenge consists of various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with the corresponding house prices. The dataset can be obtained from the Kaggle competition page here.
